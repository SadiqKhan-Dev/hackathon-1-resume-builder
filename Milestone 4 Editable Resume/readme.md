# Milestone 4: Editable Resume

## Project Description
This milestone aims to transform the dynamic resume into an editable one. The core feature of this milestone is to allow users to directly modify the content of their resume through the web interface, perhaps using in-place editing or a form-based approach. The changes made by the user would ideally be saved, potentially to local storage, so that they persist across sessions. This moves towards a fully interactive resume builder experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript/TypeScript (for DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence)
- Local Storage (for saving user edits, potentially)

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file, structuring the editable resume sections.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for visual presentation and styling of editable elements.
- `script.js` / `script.ts`: The JavaScript/TypeScript file(s) implementing the editing functionality, saving/loading mechanisms, and dynamic content rendering.

## How to Use
Open `index.html` in a web browser. Interact with the editable sections to modify resume content. Changes may be saved automatically or require a specific action (e.g., a "Save" button) depending on the implementation. Check your browser's local storage for saved data.
