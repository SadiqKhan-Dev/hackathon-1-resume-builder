# Milestone 1: Static Resume

## Project Description
This milestone focuses on creating a basic, static resume page. The resume is built using fundamental web technologies: HTML for structure and content, CSS for styling, and TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript) for any basic interactive elements or data handling. This version represents a non-dynamic, fixed content resume, ideal for initial presentation or as a template.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript)

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the resume's structure and content.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet responsible for the visual presentation of the resume.
- `script.ts`: The TypeScript file for any client-side logic or interactivity.

## How to View
Open `index.html` directly in your web browser.
