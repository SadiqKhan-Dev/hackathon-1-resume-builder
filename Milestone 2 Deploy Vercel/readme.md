# Milestone 2: Deploy to Vercel

## Project Description
This milestone builds upon the static resume developed in Milestone 1. The primary objective here is to deploy the static resume application to Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. This makes the resume publicly accessible via a unique URL. This milestone focuses on the deployment process and ensuring the application functions correctly in a production environment.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript)
- Vercel (for deployment)

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the resume's structure and content.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet responsible for the visual presentation of the resume.
- `script.ts`: The TypeScript file for any client-side logic or interactivity.

## Deployment Instructions
1. Ensure your project is structured correctly for Vercel deployment.
2. Install the Vercel CLI (`npm install -g vercel`).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `vercel deploy` to deploy your project.
5. Follow the CLI prompts to link your project and deploy.
