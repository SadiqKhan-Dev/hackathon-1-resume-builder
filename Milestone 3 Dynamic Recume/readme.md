# Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume

## Project Description
This milestone focuses on enhancing the resume to be dynamic. Instead of static content, the resume will now likely be able to fetch or generate its content based on some input or data source. This could involve using JavaScript/TypeScript to manipulate the DOM, load data from a local JSON file, or even connect to a simple API to populate resume sections. The goal is to make the resume content adaptable without manual HTML edits.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript/TypeScript (for dynamic content generation and manipulation)

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file, likely serving as a template or container for dynamic content.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for the resume's appearance.
- `script.js` / `script.ts`: The JavaScript/TypeScript file(s) containing the logic to dynamically generate, load, and display resume content.

## How to Use
Open `index.html` in a web browser. The script(s) will then dynamically render the resume content. You might need to configure a local server if the scripts are fetching local data (e.g., JSON files) to avoid CORS issues.
